SymLinks are similar to shortcuts in Windows.
Softlink is like shortcut in windows if we delete original file then softlink will not work.As both of the files have different inode numbers we can create softlink on different filesystems.Changes made in one file will reflect into other file automatically.
Hardlink is like replica of a original file. 
Soft links are similar to shortcuts, and are independent files with their own inode on hard disk.You can modify or delete a symbolic link without affecting the target file or directory.
Hard links are directory entries that directly point to the same inode as the original file.Hard links are also shortcuts for files and folders, but a hard link cannot be created for a folder or file in a different file system. If you modify one hard link, all other hard links gets modfied
